### Issues

Issues should be used to record bugs, and request additional features, or discuss
potential changes before it's implemented.

If you find an reported bug that you have experienced and you want fixed, adding
a [reaction][GithubReaction] can help prioritisation.

Once an issue is raised, it should have appropriate labels to allow for easy discovery.
Milestones should also be added to the issue.
This will help indicate what the priority of the issue will be.

When starting to work on an issue, please assign it to yourself to let others know
that you are working on it.

* Include documentation.
* Be accompanied by a completed Pull Request template.
* Bump the version.

Branch names should be descriptive, and be prefixed with the issue number.
All commits related to the issue should also be prefixed with the issue number.

When a PR is merged, it will automatically squash the commits into the main branch.
